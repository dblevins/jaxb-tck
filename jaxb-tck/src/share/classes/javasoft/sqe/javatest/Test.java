/**
 * This interface is implemented by tests to be run under the test harness
 * of javasoft.sqe.javatest. Information about the test is normally contained
 * in the parameters of a table in an HTML file that is read by the
 * test harness.
 *
 * A test should also define `main' as follows:
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * 	public static void main(String[] args) {
 * 	    Test t = new <em>test-class-name</em>();
 * 	    Status s = t.run(args, new PrintWriter(System.err), new PrintWriter(System.out));
 * 	    s.exit();
 * 	}
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * Defining `main' like this means that the test can also be run standalone, 
 * independent of the harness.
