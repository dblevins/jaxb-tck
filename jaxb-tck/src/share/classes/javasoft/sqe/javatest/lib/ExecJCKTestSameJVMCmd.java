/**
 * ExecJCKTestSameJVMCmd executes a JCK test in the same Java Virtual 
 * Machine as the caller of this class.
 *
 * <p> JCK tests may be "standard" tests, which implement the Test interface,
 * and which return a result via the value returned from the run method,
 * or they may be a "simple" which implements a standard simple method
 * which an integer return code.
 *
 * <p> It can use either a private class loader or the system class loader. 
 * A private class loader will be created if the -loadDir option is given; 
 * otherwise the system class loader will be used.  A private class
 * loader minimises the interference between tests, but you may be 
 * restricted from using private class loaders if you are running the 
 * harness inside a web browser.
