     *
     *  @param exitCode		The exit code from the command that was executed.
     *  @param logStatus	If the command that was executed was a test program
     *				and exited by calling <code>status.exit()</code>,
     *				then logStatus will be set to `status'.  Otherwise,
     *				it will be null.  The value of the status is passed
     *				from the command by writing it as the last line to

     *				received as the last line, the value will be lost.

     *				that for some reason the test did not successfully
     *				call <code>status.exit()</code> and the test is
     *				deemed to have failed. If the exit code is zero,
     *				a likely possibility is that the test raised an
     *				exception which caused the JVM to dump the stack
     *				and exit. In this case, the result is
     *				<code>Status.failed("exit without status, exception assumed")</code>.
     *				In other cases, the result is simply
     *				<code>Status.failed("exit code" + exitCode)</code>.
