/**
 * Invoke a Java compiler via reflection.
 * The compiler is assumed to have a constructor and compile method
 * matching the following signature:
 *<pre>
 * public class COMPILER {
 *     public COMPILER(java.io.OutputStream out, String compilerName);
 *     boolean compile(String[] args);
 * }
 *</pre>
 * or
 *<pre>
 * public class COMPILER {
 *     public COMPILER();
 *     int compile(String[] args);
 * }
 *</pre>
 * This means the command is suitable for (but not limited to) the
 * compiler javac suplied with JDK. (Note that this uses an internal
 * API of javac which is not documented and is not guaranteed to exist
 * in any specific release of JDK.)
