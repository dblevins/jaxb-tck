  <body>
The <em>attributes</em> package provides the interfaces that represent <b><em>attribute entities</em></b>
of a TestDescription. The <em>attributes</em> package describes properties that may determine whether a test gets built or executed, and how the tests are built or executed.
<p>
The <em>attributes</em> interfaces express the typed attribute entities
for <em>TestGroup</em>, <em>TestCase</em>, and <em>Library</em>. 
The <em>attributes</em> package also contains  
some interfaces that represent components of attributes.
<p>
The <em>attributes</em> package contains classes that will exist when a TestDescription XML file
is parsed, or a programmer can synthesize a TestDescription using the AttributesFactory create methods.
