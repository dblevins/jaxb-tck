The <b><em>Validator</em></b> package provides the interfaces that allow a <b><em>Processor</em></b> component that
a tool uses to semantically validate an IR.
<p>
<b><em>Validators</em></b> are a specific type of <b><em>Processor</em></b>. Other processors (that implement the
<b><em>ValidatingProcessor</em></b> contract) can contain a <b><em>Validators</em></b>.  <b><em>Parsers</em></b>
and <b><em>Emitters</em></b> are types of <b><em>ValidatingProcessors</em></b>.  
<p>
<b><em>ValidatingProcessors</em></b> take an IR and validates it at some point.  For a parser - 
that point is generally after parsing into an IR but before the IR is returned to the caller.  For an emitter -
that point is generally before anything has been emitted.
<p>
Most of the time, a <b><em>Validator</em></b> will be owned by a <b><em>ValidatingProcessor</em></b>,
however when a Build-system is defined within a single VM (as opposed to a chain of tools), the Java driver
for that system may need to insert a validator between the invocation of the tools within that system.
<p>
<strong>Validator charter</strong>
<p>
  A validator takes an IR tree and throws an exception (<b><em>ValidatorException</em></b>) when the IR does 
not conform to a certain sub-format.  A sub-format is a set of semantic rules that an IR must conform to for a 
given TCK build.  An implementation of a <b><em>Validator</em></b> enforces a specific sub-format.  A build-system
is responsible for configuring any given tool in the build-process with an appropriate validator.  This allows a
specific TCK build to accept specific sub-forms of a UTD.
<p>

<em>example:
<p>
    JCK build imposes rules requiring various forms of documentation (i.e. 
JCK requires TestedClass and TestedPackage).</em>

<p>

<strong>  Build-System (general)</strong>
<code><pre>
|-------------------------------------------------|

|      +----------+           +----------+        |
|      |  Tool 1  |           | Tool 2   |        |
|      +----------+           +----------+        |
|   parse /   \ emit        parse /   \ emit      |
|        /     \                 /     \          |
|       /       \               /       \         |

<strong>general features:</strong>
<p>
<OL>

<LI> can think of each tool as a completely independent entity.</li>
<LI> can think of XML as intermediary representation of a test.</li>
<LI> we desire a tool to "fail-fast" when the XML is not of the correct 
sub-format.   </li>
<LI> tool can potentially modify an IR.  Validator can be inserted anywhere 
along the i/o chain to validate the modified IR.  </li>
</OL>
<p>

<em>example:  Tool 1 may have an external interface with Tool 2 by adding 
AttrElems to an IR. A validator may be used to validate the form of an 
AttrElem</em>.

<p>

Also consider a build-system that chains to other tools in a single VM 
(without external intermediary XML files):
<p>

<strong>  Build-System (single VM)</strong>
  <p>
<code><pre>
|-------------------------------------------------|
|                                                 |
|      +----------+           +----------+        |
|      |  Tool 1  |---------->| Tool 2   |        |
|      +----------+    IR     +----------+        |
|   parse /                           \ emit      |
|        /                             \          |
|       /                               \         |
|    XML                                  XML     |
|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
</pre></code>

In this case, it may be desirable to validate the IR between tools, but it 
is very important to validate the sub-format during Tool1's initial parse.
<p>
<strong>  Build-System (using translator on the front)</strong>

<p>
Now consider that the first tool is a translation tool:


 <code><pre>
|-------------------------------------------------|
|                                                 |
|      +----------+           +----------+        |
|      |  Tool 1  |---------->| Tool 2   |        |
|      +----------+    IR(s)  +----------+        |
|   parse /                           \ emit      |
|        /                             \          |
|       /                               \         |
|    .jmpp                                XML     |
|    .pl                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|
</pre></code>



For a translation tool (jmppTrans, TestGenTrans), The sub-format of a test 
is embedded within the original file format.
<p>

<em> example:  
   A jmpp file may contain information to produce  2 VM tests.  The build 
system may be trying to build a JCK.  The build-system should fail 
somewhere because the jmpp file does not contain information in the 
correct JCK sub-format. </em>
<p>
   
   To consistently "fail-fast", the tranlsation tool should validate the 
jck sub-format before passing the IR on to the next tool.  The validation 
can happen before the IR is passed on (as above) or before an XML file is 
emitted. A build system could configure the translator with the 
appropriate validator for the particular TCK build.
