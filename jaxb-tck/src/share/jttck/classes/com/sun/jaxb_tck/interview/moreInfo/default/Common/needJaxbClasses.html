The JAXB classes must be available (i.e., can be found and loaded) during test execution. 
This means that JAXB jar archives or directories which contain the JAXB classes must be in 
the test executing Java classpath.
<p>
Answer <b>"No"</b> if the JAXB jar archives are in the Java default classpath, for example, all jar files 
are stored in the <code>jdk_install_dir/jre/lib/ext</code> directory. 
Answer <b>"Yes"</b> if some directories or archives are located not in the Java default classpath.
<p>
If you answer <b>"Yes"</b> you will be asked to specify necessary class paths / JAXB archives.
