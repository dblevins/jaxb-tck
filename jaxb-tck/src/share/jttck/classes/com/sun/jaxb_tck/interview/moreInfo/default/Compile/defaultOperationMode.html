A JAXB compatible implementation must support a <b>default operating mode</b> in which all required XML 
Schema to Java bindings described in the JAXB specification must be implemented. Errors must 
be reported when alternative/extension non-required features are encountered.
<p> 
A JAXB compatible implementation may support <b>non-default operating modes</b>. 
These modes must support all the XML Schema to Java bindings described in JAXB specification, 
but may also generate alternative/extension bindings for XML Schema constructs not required 
by this specification.
<p>
If you choose <b>"Yes"</b>, the schema compiler is supposed to run 
in default operation mode, the tests for non-required features must
be passed (as negative tests with expected error messages).
<p>
If you choose <b>"No"</b>, the schema compiler is supposed to run 
in non-default operation mode, the tests for non-required features will
not be run.
<p>
For more information on default operation mode requirements, 
see the "Compatibility" section of JAXB specification.
