Path separators may differ across platforms. When the JavaTest harness and the JavaTest Agent run on
different platforms, JavaTest must know the path separator on the test (Agent) platform to 
specify the correctly separated lists of paths in Agent commands.
<p>
For example, on Windows platforms specify the " ; "
character, on Unix platforms specify the " : " character.
Other platforms may differ.
